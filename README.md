# NYC Hookah Wiki
##*A Wiki of Hookah Locations in Little Cairo NYC*


##**App Description**
New York City is packed with hookah lounges, but which one is best for you? This app will give details about the hookah lounges in NYC. Hookah lounges will be sorted by traditional or modern, whether they serve alcohol, whether they serve food, whether they have live music or a DJ, and what their opening or closing times.

##**List of Technologies Used**
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript & jQuery
4. Ruby & Sinatra
5. SQL & ActiveRecord

##**User Stories**
A user would be able to search the hookah lounges based on those parameters (Traditional or Modern, alcohol, food, live music or DJ (or neither), opening and closing times. A hookah lounge can be added or taken down (if its closed). Each page will consist of a photo of the establishment, address, list of prices, and the information from the parameters.  

Additional features could include allowing the owners of the establishments to be able to log in themselves and modify their pages. I would like the Wiki itself to remain open to the public
